## Overview

This is a profile component challenge. I used basic html and css to build this. I made use of media queries to position the circles in the background at different screen sizes. I am not completely satisfied with my work, but I put enough time into this and got out of it what I needed. There must be a better way to position the circles than the way that I did it. I kept adding media queries every hundred or so screen width pixels.

### The challenge

### What I learned

The real challenge for me was the background circles. I don't think I came up with a successful method for approaching a problem like this, but I did learn that this is a weakness in my skillset and an area that I will need to focus on soon.
